Hi, I’m @joshred83
I’m interested in programming, data science and machine learning. 
I’ve just completed a Data Analytics program and I'm currently looking into master's programs to expand on my skills. 

I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to data science, or just to solve programming puzzles for fun. 

Something I have been tinkering with recently is a little animation of Conway's Game of Life.
